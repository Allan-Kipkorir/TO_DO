Here is an example GitHub README for a React todo app that allows users to add tasks with a date/time and mark them as complete:

# Todo App

This is a simple todo app built with React that allows users to add, view, and mark task items as complete.

## Features

- Add new tasks by entering a task title, due date, and time
- Tasks are displayed in a list with their title, date, and time
- Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking the checkbox next to them
- Completed tasks are crossed out with a strikethrough

## Usage

To use the app:

- Enter a task title, due date, and time into the input fields 
- Click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list
- To mark a task as complete, click the checkbox next to it
- Completed tasks will be crossed out

The tasks are stored in the component state and will persist on page refresh.

## Implementation

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and has the following key components:

- `TaskInput` - Form for entering new tasks
- `TaskList` - Displays the list of tasks
- `TaskItem` - Individual task component to display each item

State is managed with React hooks - `useState` for the task list and `useRef` for the input fields.

CSS styling provided using Tailwind CSS framework.

## Potential Improvements

Some ways this app could be improved in the future:

- Let user edit tasks instead of just deleting
- Persist tasks in backend database
- Improve date handling with date picker
- Drag and drop task reordering
- Categorize tasks into folders/projects
